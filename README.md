# Product Recommendation System

## Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can recommend products to users based on their past behavior. The goal is to simulate how machine learning can improve the retail experience by offering personalized product recommendations. This demonstrates skills in data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

## Overview
In this project, I developed a recommendation system using user purchase history to predict relevant products for users. The following techniques were explored for this purpose:
- **Collaborative Filtering**
- **Content-Based Filtering**
- **Hybrid Model (Combination of Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering)**

The model was evaluated based on metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in providing relevant recommendations.

## Dataset
For this project, a mock dataset was created with the following fields:
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Product Category**: Category to which the product belongs.
- **Purchase History**: A list of products purchased by each user along with the purchase date.
- **Ratings** (optional): User ratings for the products, if available.

The dataset used in this project simulates user behavior and purchasing patterns. You can modify or use your dataset for further customization.

## Steps

### Data Exploration
In this step, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the purchasing patterns and behavior of users. The key tasks involved:
- Identifying trends in user purchases.
- Visualizing product popularity and user activity.
- Handling missing data and preprocessing the dataset for modeling.

### Model Development
I implemented several recommendation techniques:
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique makes recommendations based on the past behavior of similar users.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: This method recommends products based on product features and the user's preferences.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: A combination of the two methods to improve the recommendation accuracy.

### Evaluation
To evaluate the model, I used metrics like:
- **Precision**: The proportion of relevant products recommended.
- **Recall**: The proportion of relevant products recommended out of all relevant products.
- **F1-Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation metric.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/product-recommendation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd product-recommendation
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data should be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary transformations. This can be done using the `data_preprocessing.py` script.
2. **Model Training**: The model is built in the `model.py` file, where collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods are implemented.
3. **Evaluation**: To evaluate the model, run the following script:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. **Recommendation Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can get personalized recommendations by running the `recommendations.py` script with a specific user ID.

### Example Usage
```python
from recommendations import get_product_recommendations

user_id = 123  # Example User ID
recommended_products = get_product_recommendations(user_id)
print("Recommended Products:", recommended_products)
```

## Results

The recommendation model successfully predicts relevant products based on user behavior. Initial evaluations using precision, recall, and F1-score indicate a promising performance, especially when combining collaborative and content-based filtering.

The model can be improved further with the following:
- Using more detailed product information (e.g., descriptions, images).
- Incorporating a larger dataset to capture more user-product interactions.
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters.

## Future Work
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Implementing real-time recommendations for dynamic user behavior.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Experimenting with more complex models such as neural collaborative filtering (NCF) for improved recommendation accuracy.
- **API Integration**: Developing an API to provide recommendations for users directly on web platforms.
